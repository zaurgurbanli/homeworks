1. Explain in your own words the difference between declaring variables via `var`, `let` and `const`. 

-- var can be redeclared and updated.
-- let can be updated but it cannot be redeclared.
-- const cannot be updated.


2. Why is declaration of a variable via `var` considered a bad tone?

-- var does not have block scope(it has function scope). Therefore, it can cause a problem if you are not so careful.
